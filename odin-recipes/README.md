# The Odin Project Journey

I am trying to speed through The Odin Project project as fast as I can. I am impressed with how much I've learned since the HBK rejection, and I want this journey to be a stark reminder of the tough recruiting season this year and to keep moving forward. 

I have learned the basics of HTML, understood the of basic webpages structure, and showcased my understanding by building a recipe site of 3 favorite deserts of mine. Excited to move forward to learn CSS!
