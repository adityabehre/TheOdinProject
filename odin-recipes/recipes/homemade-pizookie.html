        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup rolled oats</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>½ cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, oats, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Cream white sugar, butter, and brown sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition until fully incorporated. Mix in vanilla extract. Gradually mix in dry ingredients until combined, stirring in the chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a well seasoned 10-inch cast iron skillet. Press down with your fingers to distribute evenly over the bottom of the skillet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is firm to the touch and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the skillet, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let cool for about 10 to 15 minutes. Run a spatula around the edges, lifting the cookie slightly as you go around. Carefully invert cookie onto a cutting board and then invert again onto a serving platter.</li>
        </ol>
