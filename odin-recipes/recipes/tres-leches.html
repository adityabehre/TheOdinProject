            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
            <li>Sift flour and baking powder together; set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until lighter in color and fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla; beat well. Add flour mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, mixing until well blended.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Pierce cake all over with a fork; let cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Mix whole milk, condensed milk, and evaporated milk together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour the whole milk, condensed milk, and evaporated milk mixture over the top of the cooled cake and allow to soak in.</li>
            <li>Whip cream, remaining 1 cup of sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until thick.</li>
            <li>When milk mixture has soaked in, spread cream on top of the cake.</li>
            <li>Keep cake refrigerated until ready to serve. Sprinkle ground cinnamon over top of the cake before slicing. Enjoy!</li>
